# Irresponsible

Have you ever made an important life decision by flipping a coin and calling heads or tails?! Of course you have!! Life is all about taking risk and hoping you get lucky! 

Irresponsible is a fun little windows desktop app that is here to help you do just that! Digital coins included! The coin flips go by best of three. This means that you pick heads or tails and then flip three coins and hope the dominant coin is the one you picked. Have fun making irresponsible decisions!
